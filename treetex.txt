Design of tree macro's for LaTeX

We want a flexible system for creating a variety of top-down trees.
There are several features that may be included:
- Triangles: needed to hide unimportant/unknown structure
- More than two branches: Although binary branching is the thing to
do, we want to depict older versions of a theory that require or allow
more than two branches. Any number of branches must be supported.
- Bottom level nodes. It is not unusual to have all terminal nodes on
the same horizontal line, which can then be read more or less as a
normal sentence.
- Automatic placement.
- Movement arrows.
- Trees-in-trees: At some point, we may want to hide structure in one
constituent by hiding it in a triangle. However, we may want to
highlight some internal structure, meaning that we may want to start a
tree from somewhere in the middele of the constituent. for example, we
may want to depict an NP as a triangle, but still depict that a
certain part of it is an AP. So we have a triangle with (e.g.) "the AP
apple" below it, where from AP another triangle sprouts, labeled
"red".


Problems:
a. - Limited capacity in TeX

Due to a., it may be adviseable to let the user supply the bottom
level, or to fill an aux file.

Implementation:

Two implementations are now available:
1. Fasttree. This is a system based on an implementation of stacks as 
in QobiTree. It is in an advanced stage, has automatic placement of 
Bottom nodes, and uses a LaTeX-style specification of tree stricture 
(with \begin-\end constructs and commands). It is rather slow.
2. XTree. This is a more TeX-like implementation, and uses TeX's 
built-in stack mechanism. Currently, triangles are not implemented, 
and the user has to specify the number of levels if bottom nodes are 
to be crated. However, this system promises to be more maintainable, 
with more sophisticated formatting, and is much faster.
It uses a bracket syntax to specify the tree structure.
